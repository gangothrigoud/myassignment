            <p>The Great Adventure is a play by Arnold Bennett. It was first produced in London in March 1913 and ran
                for 674 performances. A Broadway production later in 1926 ran for 52 performances. The play depicts the
                complications that ensue when a famous artist adopts the persona of his dead valet to escape his
                unwelcome celebrity.</p>
            <p>Enoch Arnold Bennett (27 May 1867 – 27 March 1931) was an English author, best known as a novelist, who
                wrote prolifically. Between the 1890s and the 1930s he completed 34 novels, seven volumes of short
                stories, 13 plays (some in collaboration with other writers), and a daily journal totalling more than a
                million words. He wrote articles and stories for more than 100 newspapers and periodicals, worked in and
                briefly ran the Ministry of Information during the First World War, and wrote for the cinema in the
                1920s. Sales of his books were substantial, and he was the most financially successful British author of
                his day.</p>
            <p>Ilam Carve is a celebrated painter, but is of a retiring personality and greatly dislikes being in the
                public eye. He visits England as rarely and unobtrusively as possible. On his present trip to London his
                valet, Albert, is taken mortally ill. A doctor is called, and assumes the dying man is Ilam. Ilam is too
                tongue-tied to convey to the doctor that the patient is the valet and not the painter, and finally he
                goes along with events, foreseeing a permanent escape from his irksome celebrity. When Albert dies, Ilam
                allows the body to be interred in Westminster Abbey while himself adopting the persona of the supposedly
                still-living Albert. Complications soon arise. Albert had been corresponding through the lonely-hearts
                columns with a young widow, Janet Cannot. They had not met, and she now turns up and assumes Ilam is
                Albert, as he is pretending to be. They are mutually attracted and by the second act they are happily
                married, living modestly on the annuity Ilam left Albert in his will.</p>
            <p>Ilam cannot resist resuming painting, and sells some pictures, but when an art expert sees them he
                realises that they are by Carve. He acquires them and sells them to an American collector. When it
                emerges that the pictures are dated after the artist's supposed death, litigation looms. A further
                complication arises when it emerges that Albert had been married and had deserted his wife, who now
                turns up with her two sons – both curates – in tow, accusing Ilam of bigamy. He proves his true
                identity, but to spare the embarrassment of the Abbey authorities he agrees to remain officially dead
                and he and Janet leave for a new life abroad, as Mr and Mrs Albert Shawn.</p>
            <p>The play was revived at the Haymarket Theatre, London on 5 June 1924, starring Leslie Faber as Ilam and
                Hilda Trevelyan as Janet.[6] and ran until 18 October.[7] A Broadway revival starring Reginald Pole as
                Ilam and Spring Byington as Janet ran for 45 performances in December 1926 and January 1927.</p>

                <h4>Arnold Bennett, best known as a novelist, was strongly drawn to the theatre, and had written several
                    plays between 1899 and 1912. Only one of them, Milestones, co-written with Edward Knoblock, had made
                    any great impact, running for 612 performances from March 1912. Bennett had published a novel
                    called Buried Alive in 1908, which he adapted for the theatre as The Great Adventure: A Play of
                    Fancy in Four Acts. It opened at the Kingsway Theatre, London on 25 March 1913. A Broadway
                    production opened at the Booth Theatre on 16 October 1913. The London production ran for 674
                    performances, closing in November 1914; the New York production ran for 52 performances, from 16
                    October to 6 December 1913.
